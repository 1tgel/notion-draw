# Notion Draw

> Simple drawing app for doodling within [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product).

# How it works

This is simply a web app for doodling that integrates nicely with Notion pages. To create a drawing, you just need to go to `notion-draw.vercel.app/name-for-drawing` and begin drawing.

The way drawings are saved are based on the names you give them in the URL - so make sure your add a unique name at the end of any embedded links.

# Usage

1. Anywhere within [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product), create an embed block and type out the URL for Notion Draw and make sure to add a unique name at the end.
   Example: `notion-draw.vercel.app/name-for-drawing`

2. You should be greeted with a blank canvas - you may begin drawing and your doodles will be saved automatically (using the unique name you gave the embedded URL).

3. Any drawings will be saved automatically to the URL, so this means you can re-use the same drawings if you embed the same URL in other areas of your pages!

# FAQ

**Q. Does this work on mobile?**

Not really - it's currently not possible to store any kind of data within an embedded link with this kind of approach AFAIK. So keep in mind on mobile, your drawings will appear blank and any edits on mobile will not be persisted.

**Q. Does this work between computers? Can I share my drawings?**

No - all drawings are local to your computer. These doodles are only for yourself.
